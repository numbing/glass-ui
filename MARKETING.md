Performance matters in UI libraries.

After evaluating Material-UI, Chakra, and Ant Design for our dashboard,
we chose Apple Liquid Glass UI. Here's why:

📦 Bundle Size: 24KB (vs 95KB for MUI)
⚡️ Zero runtime CSS-in-JS overhead
🚀 40% faster component mounting
💾 50% less memory usage

The result? Better Core Web Vitals, faster page loads,
and a premium glass aesthetic.

When performance IS a feature, you don't have to compromise.

# Why We Switched to Apple Liquid Glass UI (And Cut Our Bundle by 70%)

Last quarter, our team faced a dilemma: our premium design
was crushing our performance metrics.

Our UI library (Material-UI) accounted for 95KB of our bundle.
Core Web Vitals were suffering. Mobile users were bouncing.

We needed beautiful design AND fast performance.

Enter Apple Liquid Glass UI: a 24KB library with authentic
glassmorphism and zero runtime CSS-in-JS.

Here's what happened when we switched...

## Performance as a Feature

Most UI libraries add 100KB+ to your bundle. We add 24KB.
That's not just smaller—it's 75% smaller.

New React UI Library Challenges Industry Giants on Performance

[Your City, Date] - Apple Liquid Glass UI launches today as a
performance-first alternative to Material-UI, Chakra UI, and
Ant Design.

At just 24KB gzipped (75% smaller than Material-UI's 95KB),
the library demonstrates that premium design doesn't require
performance sacrifices.

"Most UI libraries use CSS-in-JS, which adds 30KB+ runtime
overhead and slows down every render," says [Your Name], creator
of Apple Liquid Glass UI. "We use static CSS and get zero runtime
overhead—your apps just run faster."

Benchmarks show 40% faster component mounting and 50% less memory
usage compared to CSS-in-JS alternatives.

The library features authentic Apple-inspired glassmorphism with
26+ components, TypeScript support, and full tree-shaking.

Available now on npm: apple-liquid-glass-ui

## FAQ for Marketing

**Q: How is it so much smaller?**
A: We use static CSS instead of CSS-in-JS. No 30KB runtime library,
no style computation overhead. Just clean, pre-compiled CSS.

**Q: Does smaller mean fewer features?**
A: No! We have 26+ components with full functionality. We're just
more efficient about how we deliver them.

**Q: Will this work with my existing app?**
A: Yes. It's just React components and CSS. No special setup,
no vendor lock-in. Drop it in and it works.

**Q: Is it really 40% faster?**
A: Yes, based on benchmarks rendering 1000 components. Real apps
see similar improvements. Run `npm run benchmark` to test yourself.

**Q: What about SSR/Next.js?**
A: Works perfectly. Static CSS is SSR-friendly—no hydration issues,
no critical CSS extraction needed.
